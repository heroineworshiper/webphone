Web based file manager for Android


There's no security. It's fast when it works & easy to manetain, like
all web applications 25 years ago.

It doesn't run in the background.  Once it's cleared from the app
manager, the server is gone.

There are a few limitations.  It can't create symbolic links or create
empty files.  It can't write to external storage.

It can't sort by size & date.
