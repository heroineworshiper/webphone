Web based file manager for Android


There's no security. It's fast when it works & easy to manetain, like
all web applications 25 years ago.  It has a minimal text editor.

It doesn't run in the background.  Once it's cleared from the app
manager, the server is gone.

There are a few limitations.  It can't create any files or links.  It
can't write to external storage.

-----------------------------------------------------------
A standalone version can be built for running it without android.
